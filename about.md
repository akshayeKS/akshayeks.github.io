# About

Builder. Problem solver. I build and share observations from the data and ML domain.

> *"It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so."*

This quote shapes how I approach engineering — question assumptions, validate what you think you know, and stay humble about complexity.

## What I Do

- **Build** — ML infrastructure, vector databases, model serving, data pipelines
- **Solve** — Performance problems, cost optimization, scaling challenges
- **Share** — Observations and learnings from production systems

## Technical Focus

- Python, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP
- FAISS, Apache Arrow, KServe
- MLOps tooling and observability

## Experience

Currently working in ML and Data Platform engineering, building infrastructure that handles millions of vectors and serves real-time inference at scale.
