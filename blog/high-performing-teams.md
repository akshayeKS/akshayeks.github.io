# Building High-Performing Engineering Teams: Lessons from Football

Think of football. Consider how Arsenal in the 2023-24 season can compete with giants like Manchester City, or how a team like Leicester City won the Premier League. These successes stem from key principles that apply to any team.

## Alignment

The group must have a singular goal they strive for. This goal can change over time, but at any given point, there should be one clear objective.

In engineering, this means everyone understands what we're building and why. Not just the sprint goal — the actual outcome we're trying to achieve. When alignment is strong, decisions become easier. People can move fast because they know what "good" looks like.

## Synergy

Every person has their own unique working style. In a team, you start by learning how to work with others. You don't need to be best friends, but you should have respect.

Understanding and accommodating different working styles is crucial. Each task is an opportunity to increase synergy, not just to complete work.

Some people think out loud. Others need time to process. Some prefer async communication, others thrive in real-time discussion. None of these are wrong — they're just different. The best teams learn to flex.

## Transparency

Build transparency through trust, and earn trust through work.

Have empathy and give feedback. If you see something that might lead to a lack of focus, share it. Be open, with the intent to make progress, not to criticize.

Start with the "what" and "why," then progress to the "how." For example, if a practice is slowing you down, ask why and how to improve it. Don't just complain — propose.

## Joining a New Team

Whether you join as a leader or a member, your first action should be to listen, understand, and assist.

Start by playing a supportive role where your job is to help the team reach its goal. Earn context before suggesting changes. Understand why things are the way they are before proposing how they should be.

The best new teammates make others better before trying to stand out themselves.

These principles aren't revolutionary. They're obvious in hindsight. But obvious doesn't mean easy. The teams that win — whether on the pitch or in a codebase — are the ones that execute the fundamentals consistently.
