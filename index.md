# Akshaye Kumar Srivastava

**ML Infrastructure Engineer**

I build systems that make machine learning work in production — vector databases, model serving, data pipelines. I focus on infrastructure that scales without breaking the bank.

Currently working on ML and data platform engineering. Previously built a serverless vector search solution that [cut AWS costs by 70%](/blog/serverless-vector-db/).
